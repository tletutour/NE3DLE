# NE3DLE---3D-NORMALIZED-CROSS-CORRELATION-TEMPLATE-MATCHING
A 3D python template matching implementation using Normalized Cross Correlation, 
template averaging, through the use of libraries numpy scipy nibabel and scikit 

I had to make a 3d template matching tool using python (3). 
I found it fairly hard to implement normalized cross correlation in 3d, 
there aren't many implementations accessible online, so here's mine.

If you are looking for an implementation of the normalized cross correlation, go to util.py.
If you are looking for funky displays of 3d result or K-fold for cross validation go to main.py.
